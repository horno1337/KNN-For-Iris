Input Data:

Training data - iris_training.txt file
Test data - iris_test.txt file

The program must read data from the specified text file. We assume that:
• The decision attribute is in the last column.
• All attributes except the decision attribute are numerical.

The program must accept any number of conditional attributes, i.e., it cannot assume that a fixed number of attributes are present.

Then, the program will read the value of parameter k from the user and classify all examples read from the text file containing the test set using the k-NN algorithm.

As output, the program must display the number of correctly classified examples and the experiment's accuracy expressed as a percentage.

The program must allow multiple manual entries of attribute vectors and output the k-NN classification result for such a vector.

No ML libraries can be used, and everything must be implemented from scratch using loops, if statements, arithmetic operations to calculate distance, etc
